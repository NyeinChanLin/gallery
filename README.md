# 🖼️ Random Art Gallery

---

This project is a single-page web application that showcases random artworks from The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Open Access collection. Users can click a button to instantly discover a new, high-resolution public domain masterpiece along with its relevant metadata.

The application is built using modern TypeScript and a structured modular design, demonstrating best practices in frontend development and API consumption.

## ✨ Features

Random Art Discovery: Fetches a new, randomly selected artwork with every click.

🏗️ Modular Architecture (Modlets)

The codebase is organised into three distinct, hierarchical Modlets to promote reusability, separation of concerns, and maintainability, fulfilling all academic requirements for advanced modularity:

# types Modlet:

Responsibility: Handles type definitions.

Contents: types.ts (type separation).

Pattern: Exposes all components via types/index.ts.

# api Modlet:

Responsibility: Fetching API.

Contents: metApi.ts (type separation).

Pattern: Exposes all components via api/index.ts.

# ui Modlet:

Responsibility: Manages all DOM manipulation and visual updates.

Contents: domRenderer.ts.

Pattern: Exposes its functions via ui/index.ts.
